## What is it?

Looking For Gamers, or LFG, is a play on a common acronym that is gaming slang "Looking for Group."  
The LFG App is a basic mock of a social media app tailored to gamers to help them find play groups  
for games of all kinds, from niche genres and retro games to popular modern franchises.
