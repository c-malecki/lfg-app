**LFG App**

Looking For Gamers, or LFG, is a play on a common acronym that is gaming slang "Looking for Group."  
The LFG App is a basic mock of a social media app tailored to gamers to help them find play groups  
for games of all kinds, from niche genres and retro games to popular modern franchises.

Currently, the data supplied is not thematic and on brand. It is purely for dumby data and initial prototyping purposes.

The intial data and CRUD functionality is all handled within the client application for demo purposes.  
The client side "database" is implemented via the React content API.

After initial prototyping of basic features and the UI/UX, I will progressively build and implement an API and database.

**Features and Functionality as of 6/30/2020**

- General layout decided on. Still needs to be optimized for mobile viewing.

- Currently you can log in and out of the application. When logged out, you can still view posts and their comments, but cannot add posts or comments.

- By default, you are logged in as "TestUser." You can log in as any of the users seen in the app. The password for each mock account is "password."

- You can only create posts or add comments to a post while being logged in and only delete posts or comments associated with the logged in user account.

- Posts can be browsed by tags.

- Posts are tied to Groups. (basically like subreddits)

- Messages and replies to messages can be sent between users.

- User profile bio can be edited so long as you are the logged in user of the profile being viewed.

- Logged in user can send friend requests to other users, cancel sent requests, or deny pending requests.
