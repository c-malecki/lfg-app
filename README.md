**LFG App**

Looking For Gamers, or LFG, is a play on a common acronym that is gaming slang "Looking for Group."  
The LFG App is a basic mock of a social media app tailored to gamers to help them find play groups  
for games of all kinds, from niche genres and retro games to popular modern franchises.

As of 6/17/2020, the data supplied is not thematic and purely for initial prototyping purposes.

The intial data and CRUD functionality is all currently handled within the client application for demo purposes.  
The client side "database" is implemented via the React content API.

After initial prototyping of basic features and the UI/UX, I will progressively build and implement an API and database.

**Features and Functionality as of 6/17/2020**

- Currently you can log in and out of the application. When logged out, you can still view posts and their comments, but cannot add posts or comments.

- By default, you are logged in as "TestUser." You can log in as any of the users seen in the app. The password for each mock account is "password."

- You can only add posts or comments while being logged in and only delete posts or comments associated with the logged in user account.

**Upcomimg Features and Functionality**
